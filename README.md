## 1. Project Description Overview:

Great Food, a dynamic restaurant marketplace, connects customers and restaurants. Restaurants leverage the Great Food platform to enlist essential information such as their location, cuisine offerings, reservation availability, delivery services, and customer ratings, among other key details.

With a recent appointment of a new CEO, there is a pressing need for an in-depth comprehension of the business to make well-informed strategic decisions and optimize Great Food's potential. This entails a comprehensive data analysis and the creation of a customized dashboard. The objective of this dashboard is to provide a visual representation of the registered restaurants, enabling a profound understanding of the business's progress.

The dashboard is designed to empower the CEO and key stakeholders with a real-time, user-friendly interface. It offers critical insights into the restaurant ecosystem hosted on the Great Food platform, helping track the growth, customer feedback, and other pivotal information that can be instrumental in shaping the company's future strategies.

With the Great Food Marketplace Data Analysis and Insights Dashboard, the CEO can unravel the potential of the restaurant marketplace, make informed decisions, and steer the company towards new horizons in the world of culinary excellence.
